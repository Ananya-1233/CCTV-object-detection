Object detection on CCTV footage to detect vehicles using YOLO

# METHOD 

YOLO stands for You Only Look Once. 

YOLO is an object detection technique known for its remarkable inference speed and above par generalizability.

The YOLO model is less likely to predict false positives for background compared to other state-of-the-art detectors.

YOLO's generalization powers allow it to work well on new objects, even unexpected ones.

# DATASET

The dataset contains contiguous images captured from CCTV footage on a highway.

These images are served as the input and computations are performed.
